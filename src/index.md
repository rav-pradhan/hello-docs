Hello Docs is a tool for people who want a simple, clean way to provide product documentation with little technical knowledge required.

Some of Hello Doc's core features:

- Write your documentation as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), with some notable [frontmatter](/docs/writing/working-with-markdown) to help Hello Docs set things up properly
- Built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), which means it's fast to compile and easily extensible
- Designed with [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) in mind
- Has [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) capabilities out of the box, for offline reading
- Include common component patterns such as expandable sections and warning blocks directly in your Markdown with shortcodes

To get started, take a look at the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/installation).
