Hello Docs is a tool for people who want a simple way to provide inclusive and accessible documentation with little technical knowledge required.

Some of the features Hello Docs provides:

- Write your documentation as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), structuring them as [topics and chapters](/docs/writing/topics-and-chapters) so Hello Docs can set things up properly
- 11ty does a lot of things under-the-hood for us. Ultimately, this means your project is fast to compile and also easily extensible in case you want to code new features on top of what's already here
- Hello Docs is designed with [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) in mind. That means people visiting on older browsers or with JavaScript switched off can still have a usable experience
- [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) capabilities out of the box, for offline reading
- Common UI components can be included straight into your Markdown through the use of [shortcodes](/docs/writing/working-with-markdown#shortcodes)
