Every chapter stored in your `src/docs` directory needs to be written in Markdown. Markdown is a text-to-html markup language that allows you to write content that's formatted in a consistent fashion. It uses a `.md` extension, so all of your text files within your `src/docs` directory should use this.

## Resources for learning markdown

While Markdown doesn't have a steep learning curve, it does still require understanding of a specific syntax. If Markdown is new to you, it is worth checking out any of the following resources to get up-to-speed:

## Shortcodes

As great as Markdown is, some of its feature set can feel lacking, particularly when you want to create more interactive or engaging documentation. Hello Docs shortcodes are the way to bridge that.

Through small code snippets, you can extend the Markdown feature set and introduce common UI components that would otherwise be unavailable.

The shortcodes that are available are:

- [warning](/docs/shortcodes/warning)
- [collapsible](/docs/shortcodes/collapsible)
- [code_line](/docs/shortcodes/code-line)
