## Shortcodes

As great as Markdown is, some of its feature set is lacking for creating compelling documentation; Hello Docs shortcodes are the way to bridge that.

Through small code snippets, you can extend the Markdown feature set and introduce common UI components that would otherwise be unavailable.

The shortcodes that are available are:

- [warning](/docs/shortcodes/warning)
- [collapsible](/docs/shortcodes/collapsible)
- [code_line](/docs/shortcodes/code-line)
