Once you have cloned or downloaded the files from the GitHub repository, you are now able to start working on your own content.

But wait! The files you currently have are littered with the dry and puerile witterings of the very documentation you're reading. You don't really want to keep that, do you? On that note, let's look at how you can purge the default content and setup your own base starter from this.

## Purging Existing Documentation

In order to create a clean, fresh starter for your documentation, you can run the following from within your terminal:

{% code_line 'npm run purge:docs' %}
