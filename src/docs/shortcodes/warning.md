You can embed a warning component straight into your Markdown by using the following syntax:

```shell
{% raw %}{% warning 'This is an example warning message highlighting the potential use of this block.' %}{% endraw %}
```

This will then render out the following:

{% warning 'This is an example warning message highlighting the potential use of this block.' %}
